        "Orange flowers blossom in the spring",
        "Their fire only comes after the harsh winter",
        "They're freckled with the tragedy of their growth",
        "But, there is no more beautiful sight",
        "",
        "Clouds have been overcast before",
        "Time always gives us the light blues skies we want",
        "Yes, they may be stolen away by a storm",
        "But, they will always come back",
        "",
        "Millions have been here before",
        "Thousands have written about your life",
        "Hundreds have lived your life",
        "Yet, only you are you",
        "",
        "So bear this cross until it's your virtue",
        "Work through today so tomorrow will come",
        "Tomorrow is always so far away",
        "But without today, tomorrow is nothing"
