        "The taste of your lips lingers like",
        "the rancid smell of alcohol...",

        "my deep sea green carpet which was",
        "not there the first time you knew me...",

        "my poor young heart of apathy...",
        "",
        "understand that, my one dearest,",
        "you were my truest poison..."
