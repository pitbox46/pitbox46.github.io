        "Do you remember the first time you lived?",
        "Was the first breath of life enough to get rid?",
        "of the soullessness that consumed us all",
        "before we went through life's brilliant ball",
        "",
        "Do you remember the first time you died?",
        "Was the first glimpse of peace enough to decry?",
        "your sweetest summer flare that fed us all",
        "after we went through life's death without gall",
        "",
        "Do you remember the last time you loved?",
        "Was the fleeting feeling worth your old blood?",
        "which used to gather and that joined us all",
        "but now you've made us wait at solid walls",
        "",
        "To live for us, to die for us, to love.",
        "you joined us, broke us, loved us, fit the glove...",
        "that we desperately needed to be filled.",
        "but then you went, with pride and dignity",
        "...",
        "to be killed."
