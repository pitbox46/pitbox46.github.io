        "\"We are so happy\" Or so the song goes. The one that drones on, willingly in my foreground. Memory of pain lasts much too long, but we know it converges into beauty someday. We learn lessons much too late for the past, but just in time for our future. However, the pain drones on willingly. ",
        "",
        "The future is much too far to ever feel. Now is the time of hardship. The kind that breeds creativity and strips away studiousness. ",
        "",
        "I am sorry, and that will be eternal.",
        "I am only really sorry for myself. "
