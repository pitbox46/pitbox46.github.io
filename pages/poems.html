        <h3>Why I love poems</h3>
        <p>
            Poetry is a dead art only if language has died and we become creatures who remotely, telepathically, and
            concisely can send each other our empathies, sympathies, and apathies. Poetry exists to mask our thoughts
            and emotions behind layers and layers of beautiful images, rhythms, rhymes, and contrasts. The complexity
            that we pile on when we write represents, in some way, the complex and nuanced thoughts we have towards the
            subject. It also serves as an exercise to the readers who are tasked with searching for the various
            meanings. It is beautiful.
