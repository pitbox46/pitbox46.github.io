Despite being beautiful, 
Harbors a journey through hell
And all it's subsidiaries.

The world is too beautiful...
Such is life I suppose
In our beauty is a sadness
The kind that keeps us going...
Week to week.

Maybe there is no reason...
To be sad, that is.
In all this beauty that we encounter
Maybe there is no sadness,
If there is no beauty.

They are entwined
Like our sun and the rain
Like the forest and the beast.

Maybe there is no beauty
If there is no sadness.</p></div><script type="text/javascript" src="assets/js/main.js"></script></body></html>
