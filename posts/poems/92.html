`Here's to the crispy texture of your nuggs
Here's to the way your employees say "my pleasure" when I say thank you
Here's to the super spreader play area for kids
Here's to the kids that you make stand outside with their tablets
Here's to your authentic anti-LGBTQ Christian values - I want chicken on Sundays (I feel hated by you)

Thank you for sticking around when I told you to leave
Thank you Chick-fil-A
