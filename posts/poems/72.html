You deserve nothing from me, that is until I know your name.

Put nothing on me other than countering the retorts of common culture and common sense. The latter of which I cannot even define precisely. It exists as some extreme abstract object outside of Humanity's knowledge. We claim to know, but we are all idiots among men.

A train is passing right now. Maybe it is the train that will guide us all to knowledge. Maybe it is what will lead me to impress the undeserving. 

I want nothing more than the sweet nectar of summer's gaze. The kind that grows cancers far into the future. I want to feel closer to that inevitable pain that we all chase, if we admit it or not.

In that pursuit, I will impress those who don't need it and ignore the creatures that are starving. </p></div><script type="text/javascript" src="assets/js/header.js"></script></body></html>
