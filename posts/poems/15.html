My words satisfy my synapses

I don't intend to communicate
I intend to complicate 
In order to commemorate
My self.
Celebrate the very dust that separates
Me from you.

I'm cleaner than you
Less cowardly
More courageous

I'm more clever than you
Less commotion
More cognition

I'm cooler than you
Less competition
More consecration

Forget you,
This is the year of me.</p></div><script type="text/javascript" src="assets/js/header.js"></script></body></html>
