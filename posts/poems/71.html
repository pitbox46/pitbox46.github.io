only fires until it has no breath.

How will we look through glass of hours...
while the stern left finger cowers.
Though my phone blinks reder than blood...
even if your guns shoot towards mud.

We see the ending of peace at long last.
We know why ends to war never come fast.</p></div><script type="text/javascript" src="assets/js/header.js"></script></body></html>
