You must know, this life contradicts nature
Our souls are soaked in complications
Our hearts are marinated with regrets

You know, peace exists outside of death
You must know, this living isn't living at all
We run to make the day easier
We run to hide from our solace

You know, we may not be here without you
You must know, we may not make it without you
Our heads are surrounded by fears
Our brains are without sense or sensibility

You know, we don't know, just like you
You must know, we are empty, just like you
We crawl to get through these lives
We crawl to cut our losses</p></div><script type="text/javascript" src="assets/js/header.js"></script></body></html>
