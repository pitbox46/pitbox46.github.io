`Sleepless
Thoughts run through my head like
The triangle shirtwaist factory

I think about her,
This person I only knew about yesterday
Who knows nothing of me other than my face

Sleepless
Thoughts run through my head like 
Missiles aiming to strike refugees

Excitement, giddy, childish
Visions of the future appear from darkness
I am trying to sleep

Sleepless
She runs through my head like
A bride escaping her wedding

I am trying to sleep
Thoughts run through my head
She runs through my head
`
