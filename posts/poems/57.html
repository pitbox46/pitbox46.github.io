The blessed work unwaiveringly to have good lives

Sometimes teeth don't bite
Often weary eyes will talk
Sometimes gems don't shine
Often the best stones cut themselves

The foundations are made of evergreen, not oak
The good are made in an empire of gold, not stone

We are not just
We are not easy
We will hurt
We will frown

But, we will live
We will be truly alive</p></div><script type="text/javascript" src="assets/js/header.js"></script></body></html>
