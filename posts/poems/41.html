Who could be so cruel?

They walk this world with no intention
The moon guides the waves
But will not guide their mind

The skies are cloudy
The skies are grey
The eyes are heavy
The eyes are blank

They love here with no explanation
Venus takes charge of their heart
But will not take them through

They exist senselessly
They are cursed to live
They are cursed to love</p></div><script type="text/javascript" src="assets/js/header.js"></script></body></html>
