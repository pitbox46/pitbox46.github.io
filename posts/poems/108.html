`I ask the robot to describe feelings
"What feelings come from orange roses?"

warmth and passion
joy and optimism
creativity and originality
gratitude and appreciation

I tell it orange roses are horrible
They're acidic, 
sugary and sticky
beautiful and thorny
a perfect depiction of me

It agrees, I feel assured!
It even wrote me a poem:

"Orange roses, like candied citrus,
Sparkling with acidic light,
Yet sugary as summer kisses,
A feast for the eyes and the nose in sight.

Their petals blaze with fiery hue,
A riot of oranges and reds,
But in their beauty, there's a clue
To the sweetness that they embed.

For as you draw near and inhale,
The fragrance will intoxicate,
A symphony of sugar and zest, unveiled
In each orange rose, so delicate."

It's about toxic love or something
Really it's about nothing though
It's soulless...
Maybe next update they'll add a soul?

Maybe they'll turn it into the next O'Hara
or the next Dickinson
or the next me (maybe someday)


Anyways, the robot acts indecisive with answers
It tries to sit on the proverbial fence 
(it doesn't really understand proverbs)
I don't need a correct answer,
I just need it to be funny

"can you act delusional"
To paraphrase: "no"

In summary:
Robots are boring
Roses are prickly and they hurt
Oranges are sweet and they hurt

I'm happy you aren't a robot
It'd be easier if you were a robot
