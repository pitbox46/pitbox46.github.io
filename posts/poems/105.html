`Limbo,
Or purgatory I suppose
Just some middle state
Absent of character
A bureaucratic maze I suppose
Constantly waiting

Progress is moving to the next counter
"Please pick a numbered ticket"
"Please come up once called"

My number is called
The no-faced human at the counter says nothing
They burn my ticket - send me along

forever -
Or at least for awhile
I'm waiting in limbo

Maybe brimstone and hellfire isn't so bad
No numbered tickets there
Still, what reason is there for punishing

Heaven and hell are exclusive realms
Maybe Satan was courageous in heaven
I'm waiting in limbo
`
