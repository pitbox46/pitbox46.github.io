`The wind plays on my hair
Rustles around my head
- if anything were in there
it would have been emancipated by today

My reflection is a stranger
I can't figure who they are
- the most beautiful creature I've ever known
with their hair playing around my head

Through the window - and the wind
They look glossy and loving
- I couldn't know such a creature
who could emanate so simply

The sun plays off my hair
Shines around my mind
- if it were empty
it would have been filled by today
`
