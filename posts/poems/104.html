`buzz - buzz... My phone is ringing at a forbidden time (my eyes were closed. I was comfy) Ready to drift at sea with waves shaking me up and down through the bright night sky. How did you know I would be trying to sleep? I answer, of course - I'm a good friend. Maybe you're in trouble or you need  help or you need council right now. I love to help - I feel powerful when I help. Wrong word... I feel loved when I'm asked to help. Purposeful. Anyways, I answer that video call. My room is pure black - I was (of course) trying to sleep. Then your face appears, all stoic-like on the top half of the Instagram call. You seem fine - no tears, no expressions that would set off my maternal instict. You just sit there. And tell me that I'm appreciated. Prompted by some game you're playing with your friends (of course), but I know there's more to it than that. You know a lot of people. Why me? It's as if you knew that I was trying to sleep. As if you knew that my day - scratch that - my week has been shit. As if you knew that a sea of darkness is engulfing me. It's hard for me to stay afloat among the tide. It's as if you saw me start sinking - again hoping to be united with the stars. Maybe things aren't so bad on the ground.

Thank you
