        "A smear of flamboyant translucence marks my window. I study each streak that the rain left. They pierced my eyes with resent. I stand still. My room feels empty. No one would know. No one could care. ",
        "",
        "The Bluetooth adapter flashes blue every second. I turn it down so I don't have to watch it spark the room. Chicago was the song in my dream. It was the last song I hear. My father spoke to me in my dream. It was the only time I've heard his voice.",
        "",
        "Everything is so familiar. The sounds of my speaker attempt to drown my solitude unsuccessfully. At the back of my mind, I have work to do. I lay in bed with stress. I know about the easier way. No one would know. My room feels empty, soulless.",
        "",
        "My eyes grow heavy, suddenly. Maybe this is the end of the day. Maybe this is goodnight. "
