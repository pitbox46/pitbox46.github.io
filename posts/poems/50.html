Let me stride across the fields of black
Let me take you in
Let me take you

Maybe you need a gardener
Or a landscaper
Get one that can add back the blues and greens
The colors that I once knew

I shouldn't peer. I shouldn't pry
Be happy
I do what you need to be happy
You do what I need to be happy
Do what you need to be happy</p></div><script type="text/javascript" src="assets/js/header.js"></script></body></html>
