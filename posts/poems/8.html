Waiting for my name to be called
I'll walk on stage
Shake a couple hands and move on
Just a day like any other
Another day of me being... me

Why should I expect anything more?
I shouldn't expect presents
I shouldn't expect a surprise
I shouldn't expect anything at all
It's just a normal day
Another day of me being me</p></div><script type="text/javascript" src="assets/js/header.js"></script></body></html>
