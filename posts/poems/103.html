`Anxiety smells like citrus
If it were combined with
Copious amounts of caffeine
Some hints of black mold too
And an aftertaste of rose

Anxiety looks like that man
The one staring at you in the mirror
Wearing a happy pineapple shirt
A face that makes you cry if you look too close
And a shadow of a rose

Confidence is like fine china
If you even dare to look at yourself, it's broke
If you think you're a good person, maybe not
Why would you even know yourself

You wish you could stop for the roses
`
