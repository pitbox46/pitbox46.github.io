no
It's more like TV

We're all main characters (even you)
We'll only leave if we stop the contract
When they do write us off,
All our plot lines will close

We'll be happy in the end
It's reassuring
In the end, we will be happy</p></div><script type="text/javascript" src="assets/js/main.js"></script></body></html>
