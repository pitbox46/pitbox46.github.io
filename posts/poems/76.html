        <h1>Bonfire</h1>
        <h4>February 9, 2023</h4>
        <p>The midnight owl howls well into the night
            The fireflies blink in an out of existence
            Thoughts linger around my mind like our polaroid
            The one that had em smiling - sleepishly - selfishly
            I cannot see the blinks past your burning body
            I cannot hear the howls beyond my crackling smile
            
            From the corner of my eye lies a shadow
            - roughly your size, roughly your stature
            I look over to that bush
            I shed my last tear
        </p>
