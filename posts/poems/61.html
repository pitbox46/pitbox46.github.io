Their fire only comes after the harsh winter
They're freckled with the tragedy of their growth
But, there is no more beautiful sight

Clouds have been overcast before
Time always gives us the light blues skies we want
Yes, they may be stolen away by a storm
But, they will always come back

Millions have been here before
Thousands have written about your life
Hundreds have lived your life
Yet, only you are you

So bear this cross until it's your virtue
Work through today so tomorrow will come
Tomorrow is always so far away
But without today, tomorrow is nothing</p></div><script type="text/javascript" src="assets/js/main.js"></script></body></html>
