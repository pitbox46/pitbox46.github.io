We as in everyone everywhere
We climb the wrong peaks
We find the wrong truths

There is hope for us
Life gives no participation reward,
But the soul makes its own gifts
And the brain finds the proper map...
In time.

We will find ourselves...
In time.
We will disappear into happiness...
In time.
In time.</p></div><script type="text/javascript" src="assets/js/header.js"></script></body></html>
