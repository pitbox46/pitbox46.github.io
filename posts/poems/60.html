They are tinted with the golden drops of sunlight
They are hiding the soft sky that surrounds us always
They are hiding the warm sun that wants to see us

Clouds colored as silver as a beard
They walk from place to place
They watch us with ferocious smiles
They hide us from the deathly sun</p></div><script type="text/javascript" src="assets/js/header.js"></script></body></html>
