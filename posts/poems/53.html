Gray as far as the eye can see.
A fog surrounds us.
It's impossible, yet real.

A fog hides all
All our dreams
All our hopes
All of us

Slowly, it fades away.
We are in a transition.
We don't know what's next.
Gray as far as the eye can see.</p></div><script type="text/javascript" src="assets/js/main.js"></script></body></html>
