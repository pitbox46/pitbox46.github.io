`There's graffiti on the wall that says 
"Hang in there"
But I have a quiz in 25 minutes
And fruitlessly anxious thoughts
they prevent me from studying

At least I went to class, 
But I'll certainly die of the sulfur rain
which has been eroding my brain over days

Faces of my future be damned
No one sings a melancholy song
like the cherub eroding my brain now

I had an uplifting poem about that wall
I never finished it - it was never good
Too cheesy and a woman interrupted me

How anxious I was that windy day
Waiting for my future to unravel
Hoping my future would unravel

"Hang in there"
`
