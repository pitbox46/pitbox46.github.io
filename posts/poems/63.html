I have my right hand holding my head
As if it's some grand prize of importance.
I Will Follow You into the Dark is playing
But only through half my skull.
Ben's voice is much too soft to penetrate
The grey matter of my mind.
The melody is so beautiful
That I can no longer understand it.

Maybe if I lay the other way
I could hear the notes from my heart.
His voice could sink into the other half.
Maybe if I lay the other way.</p></div><script type="text/javascript" src="assets/js/main.js"></script></body></html>
