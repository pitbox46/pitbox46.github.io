`The trees are singing tonight, out there
Through the speckled abyss beyond the window
Yes, today it rained knifes ruthlessly
Maybe we reached a culdesac in life

But the trees are singing tonight, out there
Between the wastes and debris of us
There's an amber eye staring, glaring 
Hoping we finish this game we play again

Again we stare through that amber eye'd skull
Listen to the trees tonight, out there
That skull wanted us forever yesterday
And it leaves us alone just for today 

Thank the leaves for rustling tonight
Who are we without their natural influence
Thank the abyss for sparing us tonight
Who are we without that eternal reminder

That that skull for staring not tonight
May we rest forever tonight
`
