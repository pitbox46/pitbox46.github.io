`In this landlocked town we're just 
prisoners to the game that we claim is life
a life of debauchery, sex, and drugs
and art and homosexuality and free thinking

In this landlocked town we're just
mice that walk through the dazing maze
the maze where at the end we are given the
cheese that the scientists accidentally laced with arsenic

In this landlocked town we're just
murderers walking among our dead fathers
fathers that we stole life from so we may be
our own children free from their debauchery

In this landlocked town we're just
neighbors to eachother and ourselves
our selves which we cannot bear to keep alive anymore
than we can bear to look another in their sinful eyes

In this landlocked town we're just
pyromaniacs who burn their own town
our town that made us happy and kept us alive 
while we chased our nightmares to make them come true
`
