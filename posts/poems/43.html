Curled up, shivering
Wasting and withering
More destitute than my last view
Less stable than my first

In the silver I see him
Chasing threads, running
Finishing and falling
More confused than my last view
Less focused than my first

I wish he could hear me
My calls, my cries
My warnings and compliments

I watch horrified
As he climbs the wrong peaks
As he falls with no reasons</p></div><script type="text/javascript" src="assets/js/main.js"></script></body></html>
