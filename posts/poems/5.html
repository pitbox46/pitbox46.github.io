The pitch implies loneliness
The volume shows frustration
The amount indicates despair

What does she hear when I cry?
Does she know my qualities, like I know her's?
Does she worry for me, like I worry for her?
Does she want the little things I want?

I would do anything for the confidence to knock on 151b.</p></div><script type="text/javascript" src="assets/js/main.js"></script></body></html>
