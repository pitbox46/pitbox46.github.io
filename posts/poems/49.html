The kind that keeps the cold away
The kind that leaves me content

I long to know your kiss
The one that leaves victims smiling
The one that leaves problems behind

Someday, I will find you
Someday, I won't be scared of you
Someday, I'll have the courage

There is joy in love.
There is love in death.</p></div><script type="text/javascript" src="assets/js/header.js"></script></body></html>
