Spinning around our axes. 
Forever in orbit with the light. 
We never will crash.
Even if we did, the heat would kill us. 
We are not lucky enough to be free. 

Happiness runs away at growing speeds. 
As fleeting as shooting stars in the night sky.
Just as beautiful. 

She stood there trembling with fear. 
He stood there confused about what it all meant. 
They were lovers only in death.

At last, death will take us all.
Forever, we will pray for it.
At last, life will forfeit us.
One day, we will regret it.</p></div><script type="text/javascript" src="assets/js/header.js"></script></body></html>
