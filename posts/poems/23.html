I cannot bear this pressure,
I fear what happens at the end
Will we explode in beauty
Or will I implode into a speck of nothing

How do I keep it all inside
How do I hide it
Do you hide it?
Are we both exploding
Or imploding</p></div><script type="text/javascript" src="assets/js/main.js"></script></body></html>
