`i have taxes to do and stuff
so i sit here and wonder,
who is he?
why him?
why not me?

well, i can guess why not me
too clingy and a little hateful (maybe?)
but what's so great about never making mistakes?
only ever being the subject of mistakes
never the owner

i guess that's why him
he's never made a mistake
(unlike me and everyone who made it past 1 year)
i wonder if he makes mistakes now
am i in one of his mistakes?

surely, this all is accidental
everything happening to everyone
people being given the ability to make mistakes
it must be a mistake
surely

so what if he's really the top honcho?
i'm not convinced he is myself,
but what option do we have
we aren't sure we want to be free
free to make our own mistakes

i wonder if everyone else is sorry
or if they've convinced themselves they aren't
and he'll make it better for them
it might be true i suppose
he can certainly make it worse

i guess he's just a guy like me
maybe he had my internal monologue
maybe we share eye color
or a taste in goodwill outfit finds
i guess it is me after all
