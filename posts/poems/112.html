`Tonight my roommate got up from bed
an unusually late time for him (not me of course)
So he got out and made sure the door was locked
sirens were pulling into our apartment
something happened I guess

I got out minutes later
I was doing laundry (even though I didn't really have to)
So I got out and I went down a floor 
(the dryers on my floor were being used)

Anyways, beyond the staircase, on the third floor
there was this man in vibrant yellow and a sober beard
he was hovering next to a plastic orange bed
he was waiting for something (someone) from inside the room
(the room only a stone's throw away from my friend)

He gave me a slight, earth shattering, nod
it told me I was okay, I could continue
I nod back in understanding, horror, and thanks
I don't know who he was waiting for, or why them

Of course, they must have been the reason for the noise
and he must have been the source of the noise
I don't think I know them (or knew them)
I think it could have been me, or my friend
I guess it could have been anyone (I don't know why)

When I was a child (when I was naive and fearful)
I would stand in the shower and imagine death
I was left on my own to understand what's at our end
(God was never a part of my life)

I used to be so scared
so scared every time I got a fever and my body hurt
so scared that would be my end 
(the universe punishing me for living well)
All I knew about death was eternal darkness

Ten years later, I'm still the same
Eternal darkness is what I'm scared of most
So I should have thanked the bearded man
He confronts what I cannot (maybe I never will)
