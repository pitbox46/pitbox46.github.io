of the darkest place
but I'm standing on a cliff
that looks out onto the vast
green
sun-soaked
beach of my dreams

Under my feet is 
a fire, glowing
bright
hurting my skin as
I melt into peace
<i>I melt into pieces</i>

I jump off that cliff 
the sixty foot plunge is the only
thrilling moment of my life
I delve straight into the
blue
smooth
tide that keeps me from death

Tomorrow, I will try again</p></div><script type="text/javascript" src="assets/js/header.js"></script></body></html>
