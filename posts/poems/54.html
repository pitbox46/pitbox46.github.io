Drifting through this world
Trying to find our next line

Where is our joy
Have we given it up for art
Are we poets by choice or need

Did I choose this life
Or did this art choose me

There is closure in words
There is joy in words</p></div><script type="text/javascript" src="assets/js/header.js"></script></body></html>
