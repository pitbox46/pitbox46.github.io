With unsettled eyes

May you find what you're there for
May you settle your life
and be truly happy
and have a purpose

We see you being lowered
Down into catacombs

May you rest contently
May you settle with your love
and be truly happy
and have a purpose

We know your soul will never rest
We know your heart will never shrink
We know your mind will never be whole
We know you will never give up
til death do you part</p></div><script type="text/javascript" src="assets/js/main.js"></script></body></html>
