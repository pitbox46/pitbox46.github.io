`The guy across from me looks much too old for school
and my roommate just boarded my bus, hesitantly oblivious to my existence
however I have dreams of chocolates and roses as I tire through last night - and today
I think maybe I possibly saw you earlier, on the street
maybe you made your way into my dreams of chocolates and roses
you maybe seeped your way into reality, onto that rose scented street, to see me

Maybe we spilled out of my head onto my twin size mattress to stare into each other unwaveringly
as starlight illuminates our eyes - and the night rotates in years
as rock ballads in the background lull us into a heart-shaped trance 
and silence occupies the rest of our universe - just for a moment 

Maybe we landed halfway down that rose scented street - holding hands - descended from afar
while the sun stops me from staring into your eyes - but I see you more
as fake birds chirp away their authentic songs and squirrels trail us for food
as my voice grows thinner while I fight my urge to sleep right there - clasped by you

I stay staring at the person across from me - their shoes
I stay dreaming to fill the slow ride to my home - listening to an orchestra of glass
it resonates my heart - it might shatter at the volume
I'm ready to shatter from the volume
`
