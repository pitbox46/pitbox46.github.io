`We aren't ready to move
There's an extraordinary amount of pain in the small things 
to which we have dedicated ourselves
and we aren't ready to move

There's knowledge in the stars
if we could see them
but right now we are where we are 
and we aren't ready to move

because the little shepard kid that corrals his sheep
isn't going to sleep tonight
He's staying up for us
because we aren't ready to move

because the oranges that sit in our fridges
aren't going to ripen anymore
They've been sprayed with acids
which won't let us move

Maybe this is a call for help
We want to move and float and cry
We want to go smell roses to get high
so we can finally move

Small images of clouds keep us sedated
fake foams and strings and whites and greys 
they are the human problem
We don't want to move

Life is just too beautiful 
and too vague for us to understand why
All we ever want to know is why
We aren't ready to know why

There was a girl on the ledge
crying over her spilled Starbucks oat milk, extra sugar, extra coffee grande
She's stuck there - stunned
They won't let her move

For those of us who aren't human
All parts of us that aren't human
Just keep trying to blend in
They can't make us move

They can't make us understand
We will never know why and that's okay
We are stuck in these bodies or these minds
because we aren't ready to move

Now, we can say we know what it is to be human
It's wanting to move - constantly
It's never moving - ceaselessly
It's wanting to know why when we already know why
Staring at skies and hoping that one day we can be as pure
or as beautiful as they are
Wanting to cry, but never being able to force a tear out
Crying over spilled lattes, but never failures as a friend

It's about looking at people cross our eyes
and pretending to stare deep into their souls to know them
pretending we can call them beautiful after one glimpse
as if they were a rose
as if we aren't them

Don't compare us to them 
because we aren't the same
We aren't those beautiful souls
and we aren't ready to move
