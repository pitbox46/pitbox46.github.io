        "Clouds sprawled the sky with strings of white",
        "They are tinted with the golden drops of sunlight",
        "They are hiding the soft sky that surrounds us always",
        "They are hiding the warm sun that wants to see us",
        "",
        "Clouds colored as silver as a beard",
        "They walk from place to place",
        "They watch us with ferocious smiles",
        "They hide us from the deathly sun"
