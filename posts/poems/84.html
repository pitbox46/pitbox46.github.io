`Everyday hundreds of people pass me by - I cannot remember their faces for more than a minute - 
but I see you - a face that supersedes my hopes
There is no one as beautiful, as stunning

...you...

The one who keeps me moving through life - when I want to stop - when I want to be free
you are there before me
with your crescent shape rings that focus the light towards your heart
No one was more wondrous in that light
And I love you...

Because unlike your dad, you did not shoot that gun
Because unlike your sister, you did not get caught in the mall bathroom smoking meth
and unlike me, you stopped - when I ran

You didn't need the escape
You're still here
Your best friend shot a bullet through his head and your cousin cried while a cop mutilated her once loving face
but you're still here

And maybe it's because of the goodness of what some of us call god, or maybe it's because of the graffiti in the corner of my eye that says
"Hang In There"

Hang in there because
the games of laser tag at the bowling alley, the sleepless nights of friendly conversation
the sea foam green rug that holds pain and love, the facades that hold our art, no matter how novice...
It's all we have.

Hang in there because we have nothing to live for - that's what makes everything so beautiful
It's freeing

Hang in there because you are beautiful
Hang in there because we can not imagine a world without your shining heart
despite how grim and despicable you think it is
Hang in there because everyone around you is maimed, but you are still here

It seems like a malicious lie, but I promise, this life is beautiful
I promise that love will find your shining heart 
I promise that little grains of happiness will sprout
I promise that you are the most beautiful

Hang in there my brothers, sisters, friends, family, acquaintances, strangers
We need you to be beautiful
