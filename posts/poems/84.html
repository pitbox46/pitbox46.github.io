`Everyday hundreds of people pass me by - I cannot remember their faces for more than a minute - 
but I see you - a face that supersedes my hopes
There is no one as beautiful, as stunning

...you...

The one who keeps me moving through life - when I want to stop - when I want to be free
you are there before me
with your crescent shaped rings that focus the light towards your heart
No one was more wondrous in that light
And I love you...

Because unlike your dad, you did not shoot that gun
Because unlike your sister, you did not get caught in the mall bathroom smoking meth
and unlike me, you stopped - when I ran

You didn't need the escape
You're still here
Your best friend shot a bullet through his head and your cousin cried while a cop mutilated her once loving face
but you're still here

And maybe it's because of the goodness of what some of us call god, or maybe it's because of the graffiti in the corner of my eye that says
"Hang In There"

Hang in there because
the sea foam green rug that holds pain and love and the walls that hold our art, no matter how novice...
It's all we have.

Stay because there's a kid out there who remembers that beautiful thing you once did - they will never forget, even if you have
