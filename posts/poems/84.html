`Hundreds of people pass me by but no one is as wondrous, as beautiful, as stunning
as you.

...you...

The one who keeps me moving through life - when i want to stop - when I want to be free,
you are there before me
with your crescent shape rings that focus the light towards your heart
No one was more wondrous in that light
And I love you...

Because unlike your dad, you did not overdose - you stopped
Because unlike your sister, you did not shoot that gun
And unlike me, you stopped - when I ran

You didn't need the escape
You're still here
Your best friend shot a bullet through his head and your cousin cried while a cop mutilated her once loving face
but you're still here

And maybe it's because of the goodness of what some of us call god, or maybe it's because of the graffiti in the corner of my eye that says
"Hang In There"
The graffiti is right - we should hang on because if we let go, it's worth nothing.

the games of lazertag at the bowling alley, the endless nights staying up in conversation
the sea foam green rug that holds pain and love, the wall that holds our art, no matter how novice
It's all we have. `
