the rancid smell of alcohol...
which was spilled, unknowingly on
my deep sea green carpet which was
not there the first time you knew me...

back then, I shot mice for only fun
or maybe I shot them to feel...
something other than your sweet love
that cradled and suffocated
my poor young heart of apathy...

understand that, my one dearest,
you were my truest poison...</p></div><script type="text/javascript" src="assets/js/header.js"></script></body></html>
