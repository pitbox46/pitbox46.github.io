        <h1>mice</h1>
        <h4>January 29, 2023 - Edited March 3, 2023</h4>
        <p>The taste of your lips lingers like
            the rancid smell of alcohol...
            which was spilled, unknowingly on
            my deep sea green carpet which was
            not there the first time you knew me...

            then, I shot mice for only fun
            or maybe I shot them to feel...
            something other than your sweet love
            that cradled and suffocated
            my poor young heart of apathy...

            sometimes I feel bad for those mice
            how I looked them in their deep eyes...
            while I played as all knowing god
            who could not be bothered with you
            and your intoxicating eyes...

            i fell, discreetly like the mice
            falling for clever, lethal traps...
            which snapped loudly in silent nights
            and punished me only when I
            wanted to breathe in your soft pain... 

            those mice cannot be saved from me.
        </p>
