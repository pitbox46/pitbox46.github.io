A view with you would cure my disease
I don't want to be scared
I don't want to be scared
...
An urgent call, or two
Cops masquerading as you
A tall glass, or two
Where did I die as you
...
Time will not fix my wounds
A view with you would cure my disease
I don't want to be scared 
I don't want to be scared
...
Ambulances race down the street
Children fall sick to demons
Where did we die to him
Why would we die to him

I don't want to be scared
I don't want to be scared</p></div><script type="text/javascript" src="assets/js/header.js"></script></body></html>
