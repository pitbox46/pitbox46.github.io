I don't want to fuck up,
so I hide.
I don't want to be weird,
so I stop.

But I don't want to implode
into a speck of emotion.
But I've come so far
and worked so hard.
But I don't want to fail
and be left to dry.

I'm sorry that I'm scared.
Confidence isn't my virtue.</p></div><script type="text/javascript" src="assets/js/main.js"></script></body></html>
