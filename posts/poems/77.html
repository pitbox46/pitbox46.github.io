        <h1>My heart beats on with you</h1>
        <h4>February 13, 2023</h4>
        <p>Is it just me
            Or do our heartbeats harmonize
            To create an elegant duet rivaled only by
            Crashing waves and soft rain drops
            
            Would it be an outlandish
            To mention the perfect alignment of stars
            Glistening the night we met
            That night I wept 
            
            We are only realized figuratively
            Months drone on and I write love
            For no one. Perhaps for the void
            Or for what satanic beast picks this up
            After I make my journey. 
            I suppose those are my only readers
            My only possible loves
        </p>
